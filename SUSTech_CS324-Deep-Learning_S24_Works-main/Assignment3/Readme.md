## Assignment 2

### Quick Start

**Run the .ipynb files to start the training and get the data analysis.**

**Attention: You need to open this folder as a whole workspace** or you will lose relative path navigation for static images in Jupyter Notebook's markdown block.

However, you can set the global variable `SHOW_PLOT_IN_BLOCK` to `True` in the top block of .ipynb files :

```python
SHOW_PLOT_IN_BLOCK = True
```

And run again, you can get image output in the block directly.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch & Cuda & Torchvision
- tqdm
