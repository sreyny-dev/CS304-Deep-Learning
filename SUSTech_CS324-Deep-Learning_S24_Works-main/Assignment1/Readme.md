## Assignment 1

### Quick Start

**Run the two `a1p{n}_test.ipynb` in the two Parts to get the data analysis.**

**Attention: You need to open this folder as a whole workspace** or you will lose relative path navigation for static images in Jupyter Notebook's markdown block.

However, you can set the global variable `SHOW_PLOT_IN_BLOCK` to `True` (In order to keep the Notebook code clean, I set it to `False` by default):

```python
SHOW_PLOT_IN_BLOCK = True
```

And run again, you can get image output in the block directly.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
